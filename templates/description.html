<p>
API security contains four datasets each is divided to Train (70%), Test (15%), and Validation (15%).
The datasets are:
    <ol>
        <li>Xyz</li>
        <li>Xyz</li>
        <li>Xyz</li>
        <li>Xyz</li>
    </ol>

You will need to prepare four models (one per dataset) from the Train and test sets.
The validation dataset does not contain labels. Once you build your model, please run the validation set and upload the output to EvalAI.
Please see the baseline model code that contain:

    <ol>
        <li>Basic log parsing (you can improve the logic)</li>
        <li>Basic feature example of feature extraction (you can improve the logic)</li>
        <li>Basic model (you can create and type of AI/ML model you want)</li>
        <li>Output format (this you canâ€™t change EvalAI interface require this CSV output format please stick to it.</li>
    </ol>
Each dataset contains a list of JSON file with this format:
The log parsing logic reads the JSON and call extract feature function. The features are used to train the mode. You can change each part and adapt it to your own logic.
    <br>
    <br>
Once you upload the results to EvalAI the platform analysis the result and return the accuracy , precision and recall. If your score is in the top 10 your name will appear as a leader in the dataset.
    <br>
    <br>
The competition score is based on:
    <ol>
        <li>Cisco judges</li>
        <li>Competition average top10 ranking</li>
        <li>Solution presentation and innovation.</li>
    </ol>

Please see the example jupyter code that will help you start.
Instruction on how to use EvalAI.
